#I can use the volumes for keep files out of the container in order to update my software version when is necessary.
#We have to keep the same volume and create a new container pointing for this old volume, so the old data will be available again.

#This command below creates a container linked to a volume called "psql"
docker container run -d --name psql -v psql:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:9.6.1

#After that, we creates a new container with a high version of postgres pointing for the same volume "psql"
docker container run -d --name psql2 -v psql:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:9.6.2

#We have two containers with different versions pointing to the same volume.
