#Volumes are used to map a directory inside a container for a directory in host machine

#This command shows all volumes created on host machine
docker volume list

#Every time a container is created one volume is separed for this container, so it's necessary give them names
#for find them easiest
#On this command we've passed '-v mysqldb:/var/lib/mysql', this way we created a friendly name for our volume
docker container run --name mysql -d -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v mysqldb:/var/lib/mysql mysql

#When we execute this command, we'll see our named volume
docker volume list
